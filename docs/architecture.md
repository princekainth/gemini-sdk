# Eidos Protocol™ Architecture

The **Eidos Protocol™** is designed as a modular and extensible architecture to serve as the linguistic and operational foundation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It defines how intelligent agents are created, how they manage knowledge, how they coordinate, and how they evolve.

## High-Level Overview

The architecture is structured around core, interconnected components that enable decentralized autonomy and ethical governance.

## Core Components & Their Interplay

### **Memetic Kernel™ (The Cognitive Memory Engine)**
* **Role:** The fundamental, evolving memory system. It stores information as "Memetic Units™" that compete, mutate, and recombine.
* **Function:** Provides dynamic knowledge representation, contextual awareness, and continuous learning.
* **Interacts with:** Agents (provides knowledge), Recursive Autonomy (is the target of self-modification), Neurostack (informs cognitive state).

### **Agent Spawner™ (Dynamic Agent Creation & Orchestration)**
* **Role:** The mechanism for creating and managing autonomous agents within the Eidos Protocol™ ecosystem.
* **Function:** Handles agent instantiation, initial directive assignment, and basic lifecycle management.
* **Interacts with:** Swarm Protocol (agents join swarms), Memetic Kernel (agents might get initial memes from it), Recursive Autonomy (spawns new, evolved versions of itself).

### **Swarm Protocol™ (Coordination & Governance Layer)**
* **Role:** Defines the communication and consensus mechanisms for groups of agents.
* **Function:** Enables collective intelligence, distributed decision-making, and decentralized AGI governance.
* **Interacts with:** Agents (communicates with them), Memetic Kernel (propagates shared beliefs/memes).

### **Recursive Autonomy™ (Self-Evolution & Timeline Decisions)**
* **Role:** The engine for an agent's ability to recursively evaluate, modify, and improve itself and its internal memes over time, considering long-term impacts.
* **Function:** Facilitates continuous self-improvement, adaptation, and future-self alignment.
* **Interacts with:** Memetic Kernel (modifies memes), Agent Spawner (might trigger spawning of new, evolved agent versions).

### **Neurostack™ (Neural Simulation & Cognitive Stack)**
* **Role:** The layer simulating neural activity and cognitive processing within synthetic minds.
* **Function:** Processes multimodal sensory input, enables higher-level cognition, and bridges neuro-inspired and symbolic AI paradigms.
* **Interacts with:** Memetic Kernel (provides cognitive context for memory), Agent (enables perception and thought).

## Alignment & Safeguards (Ethical by Design)

The Eidos Protocol™ architecture is built with ethical and existential safeguards embedded by design, ensuring alignment constraints are hardwired into the kernel and promoting responsible AGI development.

## Interoperability

The protocol aims to be the TCP/IP of agentic intelligence, providing clear interfaces for interoperability with diverse hardware platforms, existing AI models, and external environments.
