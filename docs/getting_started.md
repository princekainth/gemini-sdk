# Getting Started with Eidos SDK

Welcome to the Eidos SDK! This SDK is the foundational implementation of the **Eidos Protocol™**, aiming to architect the linguistic and operational foundation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It provides core components for agentic cognition, memory, orchestration, and evolution.

## Core Concepts

The Eidos SDK implements the following foundational concepts:

* **Memetic Kernel™:** The cognitive memory engine of all intelligent agents.
* **Agent Spawning™:** Dynamic creation and orchestration of autonomous agents.
* **Swarm Protocol™:** The coordination layer between agents for consensus and synchronization.
* **Recursive Autonomy™:** The ability of AI to recursively self-evolve, upgrade, and make decisions across timelines.
* **Neurostack™:** The neural simulation layer or cognitive stack within synthetic minds.

## Installation (Local Development)

To get started with local development and run the examples, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/princekainth/eidos-sdk.git](https://github.com/princekainth/eidos-sdk.git) # UPDATED URL
    cd eidos_sdk # UPDATED FOLDER NAME
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies (Optional for now, but good practice):**
    ```bash
    pip install -e . # Installs your local SDK in editable mode
    # You would add dependencies from requirements.txt here if any
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Core Components Demo

You can run a comprehensive demo that showcases the functionality of the Memetic Kernel™, Agent Spawner™, Swarm Protocol™, Recursive Autonomy™, and Neurostack™.

```bash
python3 examples/core_components_demo.py

This script will print out the various operations and interactions of these foundational elements.
