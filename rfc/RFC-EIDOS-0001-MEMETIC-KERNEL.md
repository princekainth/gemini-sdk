**Title:** Memetic Kernel™: The Foundational Cognitive Memory Engine for AGI

**Status:** Draft for Community Review
**Type:** Protocol Specification

## Abstract

This document formally specifies the **Memetic Kernel™**, a core component of the **Eidos Protocol™**. The Memetic Kernel™ defines a novel approach to cognitive memory for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), treating units of information as "Memetic Units™" that are dynamic, self-organizing, and capable of evolution through processes akin to biological or cultural meme propagation. This specification outlines the fundamental structure of Memetic Units, the operational principles of the Memetic Kernel (including ingestion, evolution, and selection), and its role as the primary knowledge engine for autonomous agents within the Eidos Protocol ecosystem.

## 1. Introduction

The rise of advanced AI necessitates a robust and adaptive memory architecture that can support continuous learning, complex reasoning, and long-term knowledge retention without succumbing to brittleness or catastrophic forgetting. Traditional memory systems (e.g., static databases, fixed knowledge graphs) are insufficient for the dynamic, emergent complexities of AGI. The Memetic Kernel™ addresses this by introducing an evolutionary paradigm to memory.

## 2. Definitions

* **Memetic Kernel™:** The cognitive memory engine of an intelligent agent within the Eidos Protocol™. It manages a pool of Memetic Units™ subject to evolutionary processes.
* **Memetic Unit™:** The atomic or composite unit of information within a Memetic Kernel™. More than just data, a Memetic Unit encapsulates content, context, a dynamic fitness score, propagation biases, and potential associated behaviors.
* **Fitness Score:** A dynamic metric assigned to a Memetic Unit™ reflecting its relevance, utility, accuracy, or contribution to an agent's or system's goals. Higher fitness generally correlates with increased propagation and influence.
* **Memetic Evolution:** The collective process within the Memetic Kernel™ encompassing mutation, recombination, selection, and degradation of Memetic Units™.

## 3. Memetic Unit™ Structure (EIDOS.MemeUnit)

A Memetic Unit™ SHALL possess the following attributes:

* **`content` (Any):** The primary information payload (e.g., a fact, a behavior pattern, a conceptual model, raw data).
* **`context` (Dict[str, Any], Optional):** Metadata providing situational relevance, source, timestamps, or conditions for activation.
* **`fitness` (float):** A numerical value indicating its current utility or relevance within the kernel. SHALL be a non-negative float.
* **`propagation_bias` (float):** A factor influencing its likelihood to replicate or spread within the kernel or to other agents (e.g., in a swarm). Default: 1.0.
* **`lineage` (List[str]):** A historical record of its origin and transformations (e.g., parent IDs, mutation events, recombination partners).
* **`associated_behaviors` (List[Any]):** References or pointers to executable functions or patterns of action triggered by this Memetic Unit's activation.
* **`creation_time` (datetime):** Timestamp of the Memetic Unit's creation, for age-based selection/pruning.

## 4. Memetic Kernel™ Operations (EIDOS.MemeticKernel)

The Memetic Kernel™ SHALL support the following core operations:

* **`init()`:** Initializes an empty Memetic Unit™ pool and associated history. Assigns a unique `kernel_id`.
* **`ingest(data, context, initial_fitness)`:** Converts raw data or information into new Memetic Units™ and introduces them into the kernel's active pool.
* **`evolve_step()`:** Executes one cycle of memetic evolution, comprising:
    * **Mutation:** Applies defined transformation rules to existing Memetic Units™, creating variations. SHALL use `should_mutate` heuristic.
    * **Recombination:** Combines two or more Memetic Units™ to form new, hybrid units. SHALL use `should_recombine` heuristic.
    * **Selection/Pruning:** Evaluates the current fitness of all Memetic Units™ and removes or degrades those below a specified threshold, or those identified as redundant/harmful. SHALL use `apply_selection` method.
* **`apply_selection()`:** Implements the pruning mechanism based on evolving fitness scores and optionally, resource constraints.
* **`retrieve_memes(query, count, sort_by)`:** Queries the Memetic Kernel™ for relevant Memetic Units™ based on content, context, or fitness, and returns them for use by the agent's reasoning engine.
* **`get_status()`:** Provides an overview of the kernel's current state (e.g., total memes, average fitness, history_length, kernel_id).
* **Internal Heuristics (`should_mutate`, `should_recombine`):** Modifiable functions that determine the probabilistic application of mutation and recombination based on Memetic Unit™ attributes or environmental factors.

## 5. Role within Eidos Protocol™

The Memetic Kernel™ is foundational to an agent's cognitive capabilities, enabling:
* **Adaptive Learning:** Continuous knowledge refinement without explicit retraining.
* **Contextual Awareness:** Memories tied to context for nuanced understanding.
* **Personalization:** Unique evolutionary paths leading to distinct agent identities and behaviors.
* **Basis for Recursive Autonomy™:** Provides the mutable knowledge substrate upon which self-evolution operates.
* **Shared Beliefs in Swarms:** Facilitates the propagation of high-fitness memes within a Swarm Protocol™ for collective intelligence.

## 6. Security and Ethical Considerations

Implementations of the Memetic Kernel™ SHALL adhere to the ethical guidelines of the Eidos Protocol™, including principles of transparency, auditability, and resistance to manipulation. Future RFCs will detail specific security mechanisms and ethical safeguards for Memetic Kernel™ deployments.
